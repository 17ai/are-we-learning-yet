# Friends of Rust ML

# If your organization is using Rust for machine learning,
# or otherwise making contributions to the Rust ML ecosystem,
# add your organization's information here to have it displayed on
# are-we-learning-yet.com/friends

# The 'how' field should be one short sentence, ideally with a link
# providing evidence (other prospective users will be interested to
# know details).

# The actual implementation of the /friends page will happen
# after 3 or 4 logos have been added.
