**Rust is a systems programming language, but is it a machine learning language?**

Inspired by [Are We Web Yet?](http://www.arewewebyet.org/), this site catalogs
the state of the Rust machine learning ecosystem to increase awareness
of the ML tools that have been built with Rust. Additionally, this site
identifies the gaps where the Rust ML community could still catch up with other ecosystems.

If you know of a contribution to Rust ML not reflected here,
please file a pull request or issue to the
[are-we-learning-yet repo](https://github.com/anowell/are-we-learning-yet).
