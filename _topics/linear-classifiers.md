Linear classifiers group items based on the value of the linear combinations of features.

Within the Rust ecosystem, you can find a few libraries with naive bayes implementations.
The post [Naive Bayes Classifiers in Rust](http://athemathmo.github.io/2016/04/08/naive-bayes-rusty-machine.html)
using [rusty-machine](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-machine) provides a good starting point.
Additionally, a few crates have support for support vector machines.
