Rust has attracted attention for experimental neural networks.

[Leaf](https://crates.io/crates/leaf) made a huge splash in the community,
but [the team behind Leaf moved on](https://medium.com/@mjhirn/tensorflow-wins-89b78b29aafb#.pvv7a6dm7),
and with over 4k GitHub stars has [yet to find a new maintainer](https://github.com/autumnai/leaf/issues/108).

Taking a page from python's skikit-learn project, [rusty-machine](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-machine)
is one of the most actively developed ML crates in the Rust ecosystem. It also powers
[Learning Machines](https://learning-machines.herokuapp.com/), a set of interactive tutorials on machine learning.

Other neural network libraries have been created, but seem to mostly exist as experimental projects.
Some of the projects listed hear appear to be inactive, but are still listed to serve as an inspiration
for any future projects.
