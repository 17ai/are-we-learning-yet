The Rust ecosystem is full of a data structure implementations.
You can find multi-dimensional arrays, matrices, graphs,
and a [large list of tree libraries](https://crates.io/search?q=trees).

[num](https://crates.io/crates/num) has emerged as the cornerstone
of numerical types, and a few other crates listed here show
promise, but most ML frameworks have opted to implement
their own data structures, so it's to early to answer
affirmatively to "Are we numpy yet?"

The list below is quite lacking,
so don't neglect to search [crates.io](https://crates.io/)
for more specific data structures.
