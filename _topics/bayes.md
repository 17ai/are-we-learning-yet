Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem
with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

The assortment of naive bayes libraries is a bit thin,
but the post [Naive Bayes Classifiers in Rust](http://athemathmo.github.io/2016/04/08/naive-bayes-rusty-machine.html)
using [rusty-machine](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-machine) is a good starting point.
